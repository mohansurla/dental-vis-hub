## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd oralvis-healthcare
npm install
```

### 2. Supabase Setup

#### Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Note your project URL and anon key from Settings > API

#### Database Schema
Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Create user profiles table
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('technician', 'dentist')),
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create scans table
CREATE TABLE scans (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  patient_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  patient_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  scan_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  region TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  upload_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()) NOT NULL
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE scans ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON user_profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Technicians can insert scans
CREATE POLICY "Technicians can insert scans" ON scans FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'technician'
  )
);

-- Dentists can view all scans
CREATE POLICY "Dentists can view scans" ON scans FOR SELECT 
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'dentist'
  )
);
```

#### Storage Setup
1. Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
2. Create a new bucket called `scan-images`
3. Set the bucket to public
4. Configure upload policies:

```sql
-- Allow technicians to upload images
CREATE POLICY "Technicians can upload images" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'scan-images' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'technician'
  )
);

-- Allow public access to read images
CREATE POLICY "Public can view images" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT 
USING (bucket_id = 'scan-images');
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 4. Create Demo Users
In your Supabase Auth dashboard, create test users:

**Technician Account:**
- Email: `technician@oralvis.com`
- Password: `demo123456`

**Dentist Account:**
- Email: `dentist@oralvis.com`
- Password: `demo123456`

The system will automatically assign roles based on email patterns.

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## üîê Demo Accounts

Use these credentials to test the application:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
